         <h2>THC Poster</h2>
         <p class="misc-info">For this project we were asked to watch a video in class on three different subjects.  The video was called Botany of Desire.  The video went into the history of tulips and apples.  The final subject matter was THC and how it affects certain parts of the brain, the positives and negatives.  For the assignment we were asked to take any of the subject matter from the video and make an informative poster.  I decided to highlight different parts of the brain to show how THC affects the three main sections the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and the cerebellum. While also showcasing what their overall function is.</p>
