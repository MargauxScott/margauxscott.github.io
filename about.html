            <p>I will be graduating from Rhode Island College with a bachelor's in Graphic Design.  I like to try to think outside the box in any situation especially with art.  I try and create designs that have a new and unique feel. When I was a little kid, I did not realize it then, but I was already designing on paper. I used to design newspapers for fun.  I would write the articles and draw the pictures while also doing the layouts.  I used to play the sims quite a bit when I was a kid as well.  I got into designing websites and creating clothes that my characters could wear.  I really appreciate a good logo to the point where i find myself obsessively staring at billboards and trucks.  My sport hobbies are inline skating and snowboarding.  Itâ€™s awesome being on the mountain and to see so many unique designs on boards, I always feel inspired there. I want to be a part of company that I feel like I can be part of a community and we can use our minds together.  I also want to create designs that will make people stop and think for a second.  So, if you interested in my work and you like for me to be a member of your team, check out my contact page.</p>
